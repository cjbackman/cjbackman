## Hi there 👋

I'm an engineering leader building high-performance teams and AI-native software organizations.

My work sits at the intersection of:

- Engineering strategy & organizational design
- Continuous delivery & developer experience
- AI-native software development
- Data-informed operating models

I care about systems — technical systems, organizational systems, and personal systems. I believe great engineering is built on clarity, accountability, and disciplined iteration.

Current focus:

- AI-native SDLC workflows
- Measuring engineering effectiveness (DORA, throughput, quality signals)
- Mobile performance & observability
- Organizational scaling models
